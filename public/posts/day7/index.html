    <meta name="description" content="Day 7: High-Fidelity Design
Objectives:

Discuss Different Approches to Design.
Begin building a design system with reusable components.

Activities:


Moodboard

Create a moodboard in Figma.
The purpose is to be aware of the visual world that the user is in.
Moodboards can help you to derive color palettes, typography, and imagery for your app.
Shapes and Icons can also be included.
The moodboard will help keep the design consistent across designers.
Think about what your app is, and any emotions that you want to evoke.
You can look at competitors, as maybe what not-to-do.
This is a pretty creative process, so you can create several, collaborate,:
or combine ideas together.
Hopefully, the result will be something that all of the contributors can look to
to promote a consistent and cohesive design.

<p><strong>Approaches to Working</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Iterative:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continuously make adjustments based on testing and feedback.</li>
<li>Decide on a feature to work on. Assign the feature to one or more members.</li>
<li>Share progress with team, or test with users.</li>
<li>Make adjustments.</li>
<li>A Kanban can be used to track feature progress.</li>
<li>A design system emerges based testing and feedback, and combining the best ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Atomic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The design system or style guide will be built first.</li>
<li>Start with the smallest design components.
<ul>
<li>Typography, color, buttons, button states (hover, active, etc.), borders, shadows, etc.</li>
<li>Typography should include error messages, headings, body text, and others.</li>
<li>Start moving on to larger components: forms, cards, menus, nav, other UI elements.</li>
<li>Finish by assebling components into layouts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Top Down vs Bottom Up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Iterative</em> is top down.
<ul>
<li>Big picture first, then work down to the details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Atomic</em> is bottom up, starting with the atoms and working up to the larger project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Update Documentation Site:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to update the site as the design is built out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Submisson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&#x2705; Submit the current progress on the high-fidelity design and moodboard.</li>
