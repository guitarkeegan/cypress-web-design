    <meta name="description" content="Day 7: High-Fidelity Prototyping and Design System Development
Objectives:

Develop high-fidelity prototypes in Figma.
Begin building a design system with reusable components.

Activities:


Moodboard

Create a moodboard in Figma.
Moodboards can help you to derive color palettes, typography, and imagery for your app.
Shapes and Icons can also be included.
Some people like to scan Pintrest or Dribbble for inspiration.
Think about what your app is, and any emotions that you want to evoke.
You can look at competitors, as maybe what not-to-do.
This is a pretty creative process, so you can create several, collaborate,
or combine ideas together.
Hopefully, the result will be something that all of the contributors can look to
to promote a consistent and cohesive design.

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design System Creation:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Create components for buttons, forms, icons, and navigation elements.</li>
<li>Use variables in Figma where helpful to maintain consistency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Update Documentation Site:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to update the site as the design is built out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Submisson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&#x2705; Submit the current progress on the high-fidelity design.</li>
<li>&#x2705; Do the same for the design system.</li>
