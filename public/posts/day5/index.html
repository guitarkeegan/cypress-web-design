    <meta name="description" content="Day 5: Test Ideas and Assumptions
Objectives:

How do you know if your idea is worth pursuing?
Validate ideas by creating a series of tests.
Design a Landing Page (marketing page) to gauge interest.

Activities:


Try one of these strategies for a Landing/Marketing page:

 Sign up for newsletter for updates on project progress.
 Sign up for waitlist. They will be the first to know when it is available.
 Create a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; button, that is a teaser, it will just give information about when the product will be available.

This on is a bit shady, but is probably the most accurate way to gauge if people will pay for the app.


 Offer a discount for signing up early, or priority access.

Example: Mayuk


 Sign up for demo, free trial, limited use etc.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paper Prototype:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The idea of a paper prototype is <strong>not to draw a prototype of your app</strong>, but to map out what the tasks of the user are, and how they currently accomplish them.</li>
<li>This is literally a blank sheet of paper.</li>
<li>Essentially you, the designer, are the interface.</li>
<li>Give a senario to the user, and have them walk you through how they would accomplish the task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interview a Potential User</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare a series of questions.</li>
<li>Ask them about their current process.</li>
<li>How much they currently spend on this activity.</li>
<li>General questions about how the activity fits into their life.
<ul>
<li>What do they do before or after this activity?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid hypotheticals, instead ask about their current usage or behavior.</li>
<li>Think of the interviewee as a surogate if they do not match your target audience exactly.</li>
<li>Ask a lot of follow up questions. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
