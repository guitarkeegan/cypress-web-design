2. **Competitive Analysis Completion:**
   - **Analyze Competitors:**
     - Examine competitors' products in-depth.
     **Options for Visualization**
       - Make a table with key features, and brand or product name.
   | Feature | Competitor A | Competitor B | Your Product |
   | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
   | Feature 1 | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
   | Feature 2 | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :white_check_mark: |
       - Use a radar chart to visualize strengths and weaknesses. 
       {{< radar-chart >}}
   - **Identify Gaps:**
     - Highlight areas where competitors fall short in meeting user needs.

3. **Problem Definition:**
   - **Articulate the Problem:**
     - Clearly define the problem statement based on user needs and competitive gaps.
   - **"How Might We" Brainstorming:**
     - Use "How Might We" statements to frame opportunities for innovation.
     - Example: "How might we help busy professionals manage their time more effectively?"

4. **Solution Ideation:**
   - **Brainstorming Session:**
     - Generate a wide range of ideas without judgment.
     - Being critical comes later.
   - **Idea Documentation:**
     - Record all ideas for future reference and evaluation.

5. **Submit to Canvas:**
   - **Submission:**
     - [x] Upload links to your competitive analysis and user personas to Canvas.
     - Include any other relevant documents or notes.
     - I will just make a text area available, you can paste links.
     - It is ok if things are a work in progress.
