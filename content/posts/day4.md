### **Day 4: Defining Project Goals and User Journey Mapping**

**Objectives:**

- Formalize project goals and main features.
- Create user *journey maps* and/or *storyboards*.

**Activities:**

1. **Top Tasks Analysis:**
   - **User Task Identification:**
     - What would and MVP (minimum viable product) look like?
     - Try at least one of the following
     - **Poll Unit**
       - After compiling a list of potential top tasks, poll users to see what is important.
       - [Poll Unit](https://pollunit.com/en)
         - Create a new poll.
         - Collect Ideas. Basically, have users vote on their favorite features.
     - **Simulate with AI**
       - Give a list of all of your features to an AI, and have it select the most important ones.
       - A good way to go about this is to encourage the AI to ask follow up questions back to you.
       - Use it to help you clarify your goals.

2. **User Journey Mapping:**
   - **Journey Creation:**
     - Develop a user journey map for each [persona](/posts/day3)
     - Highlight touchpoints, user emotions, and potential pain points at each stage.
     - This is a story of a hypothetical user.
     - Highly simplified.
   - **Visualization:**
     - Use visual aids to represent the journey, making it easier to identify areas for improvement.

3. **Storyboard Development (Optional):**

     - Create storyboards that depict scenarios of how the product fits into users' lives.
     - Illustrate contexts of use, environments, and interactions.
   - **Enhance Understanding:**
     - Use storyboards to empathize with users and refine features accordingly.
