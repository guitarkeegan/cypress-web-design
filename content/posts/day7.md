### **Day 7: High-Fidelity Design**

**Objectives:**

- Discuss Different Approches to Design.
- Develop high-fidelity prototypes in Figma.
- Begin building a design system with reusable components.

**Activities:**

1. **Moodboard**
   - Create a moodboard in Figma.
   - The purpose is to be aware of the visual world that the user is in.
   - Moodboards can help you to derive color palettes, typography, and imagery for your app.
   - Shapes and Icons can also be included.
   - The moodboard will help keep the design consistent across designers. 
   - Think about what your app is, and any emotions that you want to evoke.
   - You can look at competitors, as maybe what not-to-do.
   - This is a pretty creative process, so you can create several, collaborate,
   or combine ideas together. 
   - Hopefully, the result will be something that all of the contributors can look to
   to promote a consistent and cohesive design.

2. **Approaches to Working** 
   - **Iterative:** 
      - Continuously make adjustments based on testing and feedback.
      - Deside on a feature to work on. Assign the feature to one or more members.
      - Share progress with team, or test with users. 
      - Make adjustments.
      - A Kanban board can be used to track feature progress. 
      - A design system emerges based testing and feedback, and combining the best ideas.  
   - **Atomic**
     - The design system or style guide will be built first.
     - Start with the smallest design components.
       - Typography, color, buttons, button states (hover, active, etc.), borders, shadows, etc.
       - Typography should include error messages, headings, body text, and others. 
       - Start moving on to larger components: forms, cards, menus, nav, other UI elements.
       - Finish by assebling components into layouts.

   - **Top Down vs Bottom Up**
     - *Iterative* is top down.
       - Big picture first, then work down to the details. 
     - *Atomic* is bottom up, starting with the atoms and working up to the larger project. 

3. **Update Documentation Site:**
   - Remember to update the site as the design is built out.

4. **Submisson:**
   - :white_check_mark: Submit the current progress on the high-fidelity design and moodboard.
