### **Day 7: High-Fidelity Prototyping and Design System Development**

**Objectives:**

- Develop high-fidelity prototypes in Figma.
- Begin building a design system with reusable components.

**Activities:**

1. **High-Fidelity Design:**
   - Build from the wireframes by adding visual design elements like color, typography, and imagery.
   - Ensure the prototype aligns with the user personas and journey maps created earlier.

2. **Design System Creation:**
   - Establish a design system in Figma that includes:
     - Color palettes and themes.
     - Typography styles for headings, body text, etc.
     - Create components for buttons, forms, icons, and navigation elements.
     - Use variables in Figma where helpful to maintain consistency.

3. **Update Documentation Site:**
   - Remember to update the site as the design is built out.

4. **Submisson:**
   - :white_check_mark: Submit the current progress on the high-fidelity design.
   - :white_check_mark: Do the same for the design system.
