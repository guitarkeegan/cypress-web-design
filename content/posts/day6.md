### **Day 6: Low-Fidelity Wireframing Flow Chart**

**Objectives:**

- Begin creating low-fidelity wireframes of the product.
- Create a basic flow chart to show the app navigation.

**Activities:**

1. **Wireframing:**
   - Start sketching initial ideas on paper or using Figma.
   - Create low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to establish the basic layout and navigation flow.

2. **Flow Chart:**
   - Create a basic flow chart to show the app's navigation.
   - Use Figma or Figjam to create the flow chart.

3. **User Story (optional):**
   - A user story is a particular way of expressing requirements.
   - The language typically reads as follows:
   > As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].
     When I [some action], I want [some result].
     When I [some action], I want [some result].
     If I [some action], I want [some result].
     
4. **Process Documentation:**
   - Start setting up a simple website using Webflow or HTML/CSS to document the project's progress.
   - This will likely need to be dedicated to one member's account.
   - For a more collaborative approach, you can use Github or Github pages.
   ***Options for Collaboration on Documentation Website***
     - **Replit.com**
       [Replit](https://replit.com)
       - Create a new project and select the HTML/CSS/JS template.
       - At most, two people can work together on the free plan.
       - You can export the files and deploy via Netlify as before.
     - **Webflow**
       [Webflow](https://webflow.com)
       - No code tool.
       - Only one person can work on the project on the free plan.
       - Easy, one-click deployment.
     - **Glitch**
       [Glitch](https://glitch.com)
       - We shall see how many users can work on the project at once.
     - **Our Old Pal, Codepen**
       - No real-time collaboration, but you can share the link and work separately, by taking turns.
       - Not ideal, but we know how it works!
     - **WordPress**
       [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com)
       - Hosting is typically not free, but WordPress.com does have a free tier.
       - You can try inviting others to collaborate on the site.
       - Wordpress is a free, open-source CMS, that is a no code tool.
       - However, Wordpress can be pretty complicated if you are not familiar with it.
