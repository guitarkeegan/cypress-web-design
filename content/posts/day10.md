### **Day 10: Prepare Docs and Presentation Prep**

**Activities:**

1. **Documentation:**
   - finish working on documentation, and host in a place that will be long lived.

2. **Presentation Requriements:**

   - Think of the presentation as a sort of project pitch. 
   What if we were a group of investors that could fund the
   project?
   - Make sure each person in your group talks at some point.
   - You must be present to recieve credit for this portion of the assignment. 
   - Use the description below as a guide, not an absolute for what you can
   or should talk about.
   - For visuals, I will leave that to you. You will definitely want to share
   visuals for your app in some form.
   - You may use PowerPoint, Figma, Website, or any other program you want.
   - You will have access to the projector for the presentation.

   - **Structure**
      - **State the Problem:**
         - How did your group decide on the project?
         - Where does this issue stem from? Is it a part of a larger issue?
         - What is the prevalence of the problem? Does it exist beyond the
         industry that you are covering?
         - Where is it going from here?
         - Who is this for? Who are your users?
         - Consider sharing a user personae.

      - **State the Solutions:**
         - How did your group come to these solutions?
         - What does the competition look like, and how does your app fit in?
         - How did you test your ideas and assumptions?
         - Consider sharing a journey map or storyboard.

      - **Give Us a Tour** 
         - What are the app's main features?
         - What influenced your design choices?
         - Any branding keywords?

      Maybe along the way... What challenges did you face?
      What role did you have? What were your biggest learnings? (reflections)
      What might you do differently next time?

      - **Q & A**
         - I will likely ask a few followup questions, and the other groups is welcome to as well!

3. **Grading:** 
   - **The Journey**
      - All points leading from each day of working on the project will count towards your final percentage.
      - Presentation is worth 60 pts, every other project day is worth 30.
