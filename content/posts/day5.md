### **Day 5: Test Ideas and Assumptions**

**Objectives:**

   - How do you know if your idea is worth pursuing?
   - Validate ideas by creating a series of tests.
   - Design a Landing Page (marketing page) to gauge interest.

**Activities:**

1. **Try one of these strategies for a Landing/Marketing page:**
   - [ ] Sign up for newsletter for updates on project progress.
   - [ ] Sign up for waitlist. They will be the first to know when it is available.
   - [ ] Create a 'buy' button, that is a teaser, it will just give information about when the product will be available. 
     - This on is a bit shady, but is probably the most accurate way to gauge if people will pay for the app.
  -  [ ] Offer a discount for signing up early, or priority access.
    - Example: [Mayuk](https://www.mayuk.co/)

2. **Try at least one of the following:**
     - ***You can potentially interview a member of the other group for this activity...***
   - **Paper Prototype:**
     - The idea of a paper prototype is not to draw a prototype of your app, but to map out what the tasks of the user are, and how they currently accomplish them. 
     - This is literally a blank sheet of paper. 
     - Essentially you, the designer, are the interface. 

   - **Interview a Potential User** 
     - Ask them about their current process.
     - How much they currently spend on this activity.
     - General questions about how the activity fits into their life.
       - What do they do before or after this activity?
   - **YouTube, Reddit, other Groups**
     - Find where people are talking about things related to your app.
