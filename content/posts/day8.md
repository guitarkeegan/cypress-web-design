### **Day 8:  Design and Prototype Intro**

**Objectives:**

- Get Started with Creating a Prototype.

**Activities**

   - **Prototype**
   - Explore different prototyping tools.

   1. **Figma**
   - Pros: 
     - Free.
     - We are familiar, and you are already using it.
     - Can get the look and feel of the site to some extent.
     - Works well for a sort of sideshow presentation.
   - Cons: 
     - Input fields are not interactive!
     - Animations are limited.
     - Plugins are painful.

   2. **Protopie**
     - Has a free starter plan, but requires you to download the app.

   3. **Maze**
     - Free starter plan.
     - Lots of cool UX/UI features, beyond the prototype.

   - **Demo Figma Prototype**
     - How to setup.
     - How to link navigation.
     - How to do animations.
     - How to share.

   - **Assignment**
     - Due by the presentation day.

     - Use Figma to create a hi-fi prototype.
     - You do **not** need to create a prototype for every screen. Focus your main features or whatever you'd like to showcase or test.
     - Inlude navigation, actions, and animations if desired. 
     - The usecase for the prototype is present to stakeholders, test users, and communicate the design to developers.
     - Use the prototype in your documentation site.
