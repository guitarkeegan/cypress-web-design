### **Day 8:  Test Ideas and Assumptions**

**Objectives:**

- Finish working on hi-fi design.
- Create a Hi-fi prototype, which will be used for user testing.

**Activities**

   - **Prototype**
   - Use Figma to create a hi-fi prototype.
   - You do **not** need to create a prototype for every screen. Focus your main features or whatever you'd like to showcase or test.
   - Inlude navigation, actions, and animations if desired. 
   - The usecase for the prototype is present to stakeholders, test users, and communicate the design to developers.
